# Goodreads webscraping for Current Readings

On December 8th 2020, Goodreads stopped issuing developers API keys and also revoked previous keys. This made pulling data from goodreads for webpages etc a pain.
I wanted to create a Goodreads real-time streaming bar for my GitHub README. I tried searching everywhere on the internet but didn't find a good working way. Either they 
are outdated or require third-party deployments. Hence, I had to put my mind into this to create a near API for Goodreads from public URL. This can be used by anybody. Feel free 
to fork it!
